This only works on firefox
so make sure to install firefox and set it as you're default browser then run this script
also make sure to do 'pip install instapy' in the terminal

How this bot works(main.py) :
It follows small accounts (which are more active and interactive than large accounts)
it only looks for the accounts that have specific tags that you will add into the script
just go to line 10 and edit the tags as you like
and then comments and likes their posts.
And of course as usual
they will follow you back
and it keeps doing it

For the unfollowing bot
uh it basically just unfollows everyone rapidly
simple
